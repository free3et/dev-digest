# server — insights

Durable findings recorded by the `engineering-insights` skill: things that are
true about this code but not visible in it. Append-only — correct a stale entry
with a dated note beneath it rather than editing it away.

Sections are fixed. Add to the one that fits; never invent a new heading.

## What Works

- **2026-09-20** — Testing conventions need a *second* ranked sample, not a
  looser `isJunkPath`: that filter is shared with onboarding, so dropping
  `.test.`/`.spec.` there is still correct. Extract now calls
  `getConventionTestSamples(repoId, 4)` (test-looking paths minus configs /
  migrations) on top of CONFIG + `getConventionSamples(12)`. Evidence:
  `src/modules/repo-intel/helpers.ts` (`isConventionTestPath`),
  `src/modules/conventions/service.ts` (sample concat).

- **2026-08-05** — Field ORDER in a `completeStructured` zod schema is generation order, and moving the classification/score fields to LAST is what makes them informative: with `category` and `confidence` declared before `rule`, a live conventions scan of `angular-osf` labelled all 12 candidates `imports` and scored every one exactly 0.90; with them after `rule` + evidence (plus an `occurrences` count the model must fill in first), the same model on the same repo returned 5 distinct categories and confidences spanning 0.50-0.95. Evidence: `src/modules/conventions/prompt.ts` (`ExtractionSchema` field order + the note on it).

## What Doesn't Work

- **2026-10-07** — "Exactly one model call" is NOT guaranteed by calling
  `completeStructured` once: the real adapters default `maxRetries` to 2 and
  reprompt on a schema failure (up to 3 billed calls), while `MockLLMProvider`
  never loops, so a "1 call" assertion passes in tests and fails in production.
  Pass `{ maxRetries: 0, maxTokens, timeoutMs }` and assert those fields on the
  captured request, not just the call count. `src/adapters/llm/openai.ts:90-129`,
  `src/modules/brief/service.ts`, `test/brief-service.test.ts`.

- **2026-09-18** — The PR list's cost column was built as "latest completed run's cost", not "sum of every completed run's cost", and the wrong semantics was documented as deliberate in the contract comment (`// USD cost of the LATEST COMPLETED run… Deliberately not a sum across runs`) — a reviewer reading the comment alone would conclude the behavior was intentional and correct. The underlying query (`doneRunCostsForPulls`) already returns every `done` run per PR; only the grouping function picked the first one. Fixed by replacing `pickLatestCostByPr` with `sumCostByPr` (skips `costUsd: null` runs rather than zeroing the sum) and correcting the contract comment in both `server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts` and its client hand-copy. When a list column is described as "the latest X" or "not a sum", check the actual product requirement before trusting the comment — it can describe what was built, not what was asked for. Evidence: `server/src/modules/pulls/helpers.ts:83-98`.

- **2026-07-29** — A green `pnpm test` does not mean the integration tests ran: `*.it.test.ts` files self-skip when no Docker daemon is reachable, so a machine without Docker reports success having exercised none of the DB paths. Evidence: `server/test/helpers/pg.ts:10`.

- **2026-07-29** — `TESTING.md:43` promises a Windows `typecheck` job as the `@ast-grep/napi` prebuilt gate; the gate no longer exists, so a missing win32 prebuilt now reaches users uncaught. Evidence: commit `b7838c8` *"ci(server): drop the Windows typecheck matrix"*.

- **2026-07-29** — `TESTING.md:83` explains the test-lane invocation by claiming `server/package.json` is `skip-worktree`; it is not, in a fresh clone, so anyone reasoning from that premise is reasoning from a local artifact. Evidence: `git ls-files -v | grep -v '^H'` returns nothing. The consequence it describes still holds — CI calls `pnpm exec vitest run …` because no `test:unit` / `test:integration` scripts are committed.

- **2026-08-05** — Not one route declares `schema.response`, so the zod serializer compiler wired at `app.ts:65` has nothing to compile: the response allowlist that would stop a handler leaking extra fields is inactive, and the `isResponseSerializationError` branch at `app.ts:130-134` is unreachable. Evidence: `grep -rn "response:" src/modules/` returns nothing across 37 routes in 8 modules.
  - **2026-10-01** — Partly stale: `reviews/routes.ts` (smart-diff etc.) and the new `blast/routes.ts` declare `schema.response`, so the serializer is active for those routes; the rest still have none. Evidence: `grep -rn "response:" src/modules/`.

- **2026-08-05** — Nothing in the server runs inside a DB transaction, so multi-write sequences are non-atomic by construction — a crash mid-`insertReview`→`insertFindings`→`markReviewed` leaves a findings-less review on a PR already marked reviewed, and the `delete`+`insert` of `pr_files`/`pr_commits` inside the PR-detail GET can destroy the persisted diff the offline path falls back to. Evidence: `grep -rn "\.transaction(" src/` returns nothing; `src/modules/reviews/run-executor.ts:218-234`, `src/modules/pulls/routes.ts:240-263,279`.

- **2026-08-05** — `src/db/schema/reviews.ts` and `src/db/schema/runs.ts` declare zero indexes, so the queries the PR list and the 4s active-runs poll actually run (`inArray(findings.reviewId, …)`, `reviews` by `pr_id`, `agent_runs` by `pr_id`+`ran_at`) have no index behind them — Postgres does not index foreign keys automatically. Evidence: `src/modules/pulls/routes.ts:131-133,158,176-180`.
  - **2026-08-05** — Resolved: the three indexes exist, but note the trap that nearly shipped them dead — adding `index()` to a Drizzle schema changes NOTHING until `pnpm db:generate` writes a migration, and this repo does not apply migrations on boot, so the TypeScript and the database disagreed silently. Evidence: `src/db/migrations/0012_silky_diamondback.sql` (was `0011_…` before the journal repair renumbered 0011–0015 to 0012–0016).
    - **2026-08-05** — The second half of that trap bites even after the migration file exists: generating it does not apply it, and `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm test` all pass because the integration lane runs migrations on a fresh testcontainer. The developer's own DB only fails at request time, as a raw Postgres `column <table>.<col> does not exist`. A schema change is three steps — edit, `pnpm db:generate`, `pnpm db:migrate` — and the third is the one nothing reminds you about. Evidence: adding `agent_skills.enabled` (migration `0014_old_rawhide_kid.sql`, was `0013_…`).

- **2026-08-05** — An agent's `agent_versions` snapshot is not reproducible with respect to its skills: `snapshotVersion` reads the current links into `config_json.skills`, but `setSkills` / `linkSkill` / `unlinkSkill` never snapshot and `isConfigChange` has no skill field, so relinking skills changes what version N's prompt would assemble to while version N stays version N. Evidence: `src/modules/agents/repository.ts:148-166` vs `:208-235`; `src/modules/agents/helpers.ts:61-85`.

- **2026-08-05** — `pnpm db:generate` run on a machine whose migration journal diverged from upstream main silently REWRITES committed `_journal.json` history instead of appending: commit `641b637` replaced entry 10's tag with `0010_polite_sasquatch` (a file that exists on no branch) and dropped `0011_nasty_pretty_boy`, so every fresh-DB lane crashed with `No file …0010_polite_sasquatch.sql found` while every already-migrated DB kept passing, and the regenerated snapshots lost the `critical_count`/`warning_count`/`suggestion_count` columns that `src/db/schema/runs.ts:39` still declares. Evidence: `git diff ae55e4b 641b637 -- server/src/db/migrations/meta/_journal.json`.
  - The repair, for next time: restore upstream's journal entries and `meta/0011_snapshot.json`, renumber the branch's migrations/snapshots after them (here 0011–0015 → 0012–0016), re-add the lost columns to the renumbered snapshots, relink the first renumbered snapshot's `prevId`, and hand-apply the lost columns to any DB that migrated from the broken journal — drizzle's migrator compares only `when` timestamps, so a restored older entry never auto-applies to an existing DB.

- **2026-08-05** — An import of a package absent from both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` passes typecheck, unit, and integration lanes locally because a stray copy sits in `server/node_modules` (`fflate`, imported at `src/modules/skills/service.ts:1`), and only a fresh `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` exposes it as TS2307 — verify a new import against a clean worktree install, not the dev tree. Evidence: `grep fflate package.json pnpm-lock.yaml` returned nothing while `pnpm typecheck` was green.

## Codebase Patterns

- **2026-10-05** — The clone's working tree is always the default branch:
  `sync` runs `reset --hard origin/<default>`, and a PR head exists only as
  the ref `pr-<n>`. Anything that reads repo files from the tree (e.g. project
  context docs) sees local edits but never the PR's changes, and a resync wipes
  those edits. `readFile` follows symlinks; `readFileAt(ref, path)` does not, so
  a tree read needs its own `lstat`/`realpath` guard.
  `server/src/adapters/git/simple-git.ts:79-95,136-168`
  - **2026-10-06** — Audited for project-context writes, so a local `.md` edit
    in the clone is safe: every working-tree reader gates by extension before
    it reads (`walkClone` `SUPPORTED_EXT`, `parseChangedFiles`, ripgrep
    `symbols`/`references` `CODE_EXT`, conventions `CONFIG_FILES`), and review
    input is commit-based (`git.diff`, `readFileAt`). `sync` is the only thing
    that touches tracked files (`reset --hard`, no `clean`), so an untracked
    `.<name>.<rand>.tmp` left by a crashed write survives a resync — keep the
    `.tmp` suffix, the indexers rely on the extension allowlist, not on
    dotfile hiding. The one ungated reader is `RipgrepCodeIndex.grepWithNode`,
    which has no non-test caller; a new caller would see `.md` and temp files.
    The clone dir defaults to `~/.devdigest/workspace` (`DEVDIGEST_CLONE_DIR`),
    not `server/clones/` as `server/CLAUDE.md` says.
    `src/adapters/codeindex/ripgrep.ts:83-92`, `src/platform/config.ts:86-88`

- **2026-10-01** — `repoIntel.getBlastRadius` is shallower than its types
  suggest, and `GET /pulls/:id/blast` inherits every gap. `MAX_CALLERS_PER_SYMBOL`
  (20) is applied as one global cut after the rank sort, so a symbol can lose
  all its callers; the ripgrep fallback is uncapped and returns no `factsByFile`
  (empty per-symbol endpoints/crons while `degraded`); only `reason: 'no_data'`
  is ever emitted; `BlastCallerRow.viaSymbol` is a bare name, so same-named
  symbols in different files merge into one `downstream` group — take symbol
  counts from the groups, not `changed_symbols.length`. A real fix needs a
  `viaFile` on the row. `src/modules/repo-intel/service.ts:233,307,383-387`,
  `src/modules/blast/helpers.ts`

- **2026-10-01** — `POST /pulls/:id/review` is fire-and-forget: it returns
  `{ runs, reviews: [] }` as soon as the run rows exist, and the executor runs
  detached (`void this.executor.executeRuns(...)`). The `ReviewRunResponse`
  doc comment saying persisted reviews come back "once the (synchronous) run
  completes" is wrong. A caller that wants the result must follow
  `GET /runs/:id/events` (SSE) until it closes, then read
  `GET /pulls/:id/reviews`. `src/modules/reviews/service.ts:144-148`,
  `src/vendor/shared/contracts/review-api.ts:41-43`

- **2026-10-01** — A run requested with `{agentId}` starts even when that agent
  is disabled: `resolveTargets` uses `agents.getById`, which filters by
  workspace and id but not `enabled`; only the `{all:true}` path
  (`listEnabled`) honours the switch. A client that must not run disabled
  agents has to check `GET /agents` itself. `src/modules/reviews/service.ts:62-65`,
  `src/modules/agents/repository.ts:89-95`

- **2026-09-19** — Skill stats (`GET /skills/stats`, `/skills/:id/stats`) are derived at read time, never stored: a run "pulled" a skill iff a line of `run_traces.trace->'prompt_assembly'->>'skills'` equals `### <skill name>` exactly (line-anchored, no regex/LIKE), over done runs of the linked agents in the last 30 days, and findings come through `reviews.run_id`. Consequences to know before "fixing" a number: a renamed skill starts a fresh history under its new name, runs from before the skill was linked or before traces existed count as not pulled, and a skill body that itself contains a `### <other-skill-name>` line would count as a pull of that other skill. Evidence: `src/modules/skills/helpers.ts` (`skillWasPulled`, `computeSkillStats`), `test/skills-stats.test.ts`.

- **2026-09-19** — A skill reaches an agent's prompt only when BOTH switches are on — `skills.enabled` and `agent_skills.enabled` — and in `agent_skills.order`; `AgentsRepository.enabledSkillsForPrompt` is the single place that decides, and `POST /agents/:id/skills` (reorder) keeps each link's `enabled` (delete-not-in-list + upsert of `order`, one transaction) instead of the older delete-all/insert-all that reset every switch to on. Imports never store: `POST /skills/import/preview` parses `.md`/`.zip` (only the markdown core is inflated, with a size cap taken from the zip directory; other entries are listed as ignored and never read) and the caller confirms with `POST /skills` (`source: 'imported_file'`); third-party sources get a `> Third-party skill…` line in their prompt block. Evidence: `src/modules/agents/repository.ts` (`enabledSkillsForPrompt`, `setSkills`), `src/modules/skills/helpers.ts` (`extractFromArchive`), `test/skills.it.test.ts`.

- **2026-07-29** — Twelve tables in `src/db/schema/` have zero references outside their own schema file and are meant to stay empty until a course lesson fills them, so an unused table is not dead code. Evidence: `server/README.md:9-14`.

  `ci_installations` · `ci_runs` · `code_chunks` · `composed_reviews` ·
  `conformance_checks` · `digests` · `eval_cases` · `eval_runs` ·
  `installed_plugins` · `multi_agent_runs` · `pr_brief` · `skill_versions`

- **2026-07-29** — `modules/reviews/repository.ts` and `modules/reviews/repository/` are one design, not a duplicate: the file is the facade (the only DB layer for the review domain), the directory holds query implementations split by aggregate. Evidence: `src/modules/reviews/repository.ts:11`. Add queries in the directory; keep the facade as the entry point.

- **2026-07-29** — `platform/prompt.ts` and `platform/prompts.ts` differ by one character and do unrelated jobs: the first is a re-export shim over `reviewer-core` for per-request data, the second a template loader for `src/prompts/*.md` with `{{var}}` interpolation. Evidence: `src/platform/prompts.ts:1-12`.

- **2026-07-29** — Three files in `src/platform/` are pure re-exports of `@devdigest/reviewer-core` and must not be edited to change behaviour: `prompt.ts`, `grounding.ts`, `structured.ts`. Evidence: `src/platform/grounding.ts:1-6`.

- **2026-08-05** — `modules/pulls/` is the only module that never grew past routes-only, so its 382-line `routes.ts` holds 18 direct `container.db` calls, the GitHub sync, and DTO mapping inline while `agents` / `repos` / `reviews` / `repo-intel` all have `service.ts` + `repository.ts` — treat it as the outlier to fix, not as a second sanctioned shape. Evidence: `src/modules/pulls/routes.ts` (only sibling is `status.ts`).
  - **2026-08-05** — Sharpening: `pulls` is the largest case but not the only one — four of the eight modules query the DB straight from the transport layer. Evidence: `grep -rln "db/schema" src/modules/*/routes.ts` → `polling`, `pulls`, `settings`, `workspace` (each also imports `drizzle-orm` in `routes.ts`).
    - **2026-08-05** — Resolved: all four are clean and both greps now return nothing; `pulls` went to `repository`+`helpers`+`service` (routes.ts 382→52 lines), `settings` to `repository`+`service`, while `polling`/`workspace` stayed routes-only and reach shared tables through the new `container.reposRepo` / `container.pullsRepo`. Evidence: `src/platform/container.ts` (`reposRepo`, `pullsRepo` getters); the rule that keeps it that way is `transport-never-queries` in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`.
      - **2026-09-19** — Correction, only `pulls` holds on this branch: commit `c6af1e4` ("restore main to the starter state") reverted the rest, so the "Resolved" note above and every `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` / `eslint.config.mjs` / `pnpm arch` reference in this file describe a state that is not checked out — neither config file exists and there is no `arch` script. `settings/` has no `service.ts`/`repository.ts`, and `settings`, `polling` and `workspace` `routes.ts` still import `drizzle-orm` + `db/schema`, as does `repos/helpers.ts:2`; `container.reposRepo` / `container.pullsRepo` do not exist. Evidence: `grep -rln "db/schema\|drizzle-orm" src/modules/*/routes.ts src/modules/*/helpers.ts` → `polling`, `settings`, `workspace` routes + `repos/helpers.ts`; `ls -a server | grep -i "cruiser\|eslint"` → nothing. Check the branch before trusting a "Resolved" note.

- **2026-08-05** — `rollupSeverities` in `src/modules/pulls/status.ts:23` is dead in production and only its test keeps it alive: it returns lowercase `{critical, warning, suggestion}` while the wire contract's `findings_counts` is uppercase `{CRITICAL, WARNING, SUGGESTION}`, so the PR-list rollup could never use it and counts them separately. Evidence: `grep -rn rollupSeverities src/ test/` → one definition, one test import; `src/vendor/shared/contracts/platform.ts:178-183`.

- **2026-08-05** — `no-cross-module-internals` bans importing another module's `helpers.ts`, and the container only shares *repositories*, so a pure row→DTO mapper that two modules both need has no shared home: it is duplicated on purpose. The agents module maps a skill row itself (`toAgentSkillDetail`) rather than importing the skills module's `toSkillDto`. Only `constants.ts` / `types.ts` are importable across modules. Evidence: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:29-40`, `src/modules/agents/helpers.ts` (`toAgentSkillDetail`).

- **2026-08-05** — `src/db/rows.ts` is the sanctioned home for a row type two modules both need, and it is load-bearing rather than stylistic: `dependency-cruiser` runs with `tsPreCompilationDeps: false`, so a cross-module `import type { X } from '../other/repository.js'` is erased before the graph is built and the `no-cross-module-internals` rule cannot see it — the convention is the only thing catching that reach. Evidence: `src/db/rows.ts:3-11`.

- **2026-08-05** — `modules/settings/feature-models.ts` is the one cross-module import the arch rules allow into another module's folder — `no-cross-module-internals` bans only `service|repository|routes|helpers|run-executor|diff-loader|findings|status`, so a system LLM feature resolves its model with a direct `import { resolveFeatureModel } from '../settings/feature-models.js'` rather than through the container. Evidence: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:29-40`, `src/modules/conventions/service.ts:11` (`pnpm arch` clean).

- **2026-08-05** — `src/adapters/mocks.ts` doubles as a spec for unbuilt features: `MockLLMOptions.structuredBySchema` names the schemas of a conventions flow that did not exist (`'ConventionFileSelection'` then `'ConventionExtraction'`), so the intended two-step design — model RANKS a code-built candidate file list, then extracts — is discoverable there before any module is written. Evidence: `src/adapters/mocks.ts:46-52`.

- **2026-08-05** — `src/adapters/` is not a pure IO ring: it also holds pure functions that services legitimately import, so an import-path rule of the form "services must not import `adapters/*`" would flag correct code — classify by whether the code leaves the process, not by folder. Evidence: `src/adapters/git/diff-parser.ts:14` (`parseUnifiedDiff`, imported by `src/modules/reviews/diff-loader.ts:3`), `src/adapters/codeindex/extract.ts:182` (`extractEndpoints`, imported by `src/modules/repo-intel/service.ts:22`).

## Tool & Library Notes

- **2026-10-06** — To assert a log line in an `app.inject` test: `buildApp` takes
  no logger or stream and `pino` is not a direct dependency (only
  `pino-pretty`), so it cannot be imported under pnpm. Wrap `app.log.child`
  and record each child's `info` call; this works at `LOG_LEVEL=warn` because
  the wrapper sees calls regardless of level, and the handler must log via
  `req.log.info(...)` (a call on `app.log` is not captured). Also,
  `pnpm typecheck` excludes `server/test/**`, so only vitest catches type
  errors in a test file. `test/project-context.it.test.ts` (NFR-4 case)

- **2026-09-25** — `StructuredRequest` (`src/vendor/shared/adapters.ts:55`) has
  no abort `signal` and neither the server LLM adapters nor reviewer-core's
  `OpenRouterProvider` read one, so a timeout around `completeStructured` only
  races the promise: the call stays in flight and is still billed. Callers
  must guard persistence themselves — `ensureIntent` sets `state.cancelled` in
  its catch and checks it before `upsertIntent`, and keeps an in-process
  negative cache (`pr_id:head_sha:input_hash`, 5 min, 200 entries) that
  `force` bypasses and that resets on restart. Real cancellation needs a
  `signal` field on the port plus both adapters. Evidence:
  `src/modules/reviews/intent-deriver.ts:91,124-131,293`.

- **2026-08-05** — Drizzle's `text('col', { enum: [...] })` narrows the TypeScript type only and emits no DB constraint, so `reviews.kind` and every status column are unconstrained free text in Postgres — the boot-time run reaper matching `status='running'` is protected by nothing but convention. Evidence: `src/db/schema/reviews.ts:19`, `src/db/schema/runs.ts:27`, `src/app.ts:81`; the repo has zero `check(` declarations.
  - **2026-08-05** — Partly resolved: `check()` (exported from `drizzle-orm/pg-core` since well before the pinned 0.38.4) now guards the seven live review-pipeline columns. Evidence: `src/db/migrations/0013_condemned_stranger.sql` (was `0012_…` before the journal repair renumbered it). Two caveats — `ADD CONSTRAINT … CHECK` VALIDATES existing rows, so the migration fails outright on a DB holding a legacy value, and a CHECK is satisfied when its expression is NULL, so nullable columns need no explicit `OR IS NULL`.

- **2026-08-05** — `pull_requests.status` is the one status column that cannot take a CHECK like the others: the column is documented as GitHub's merge state (open/merged/closed) but its DEFAULT is `'needs_review'`, a review status, so both vocabularies are legitimately present in the same column. Evidence: `src/db/schema/pulls.ts:25` vs `src/modules/pulls/status.ts:41-42`.

- **2026-08-05** — `dependency-cruiser` runs on the RUNTIME graph here (`tsPreCompilationDeps: false`), so an UNUSED import is erased by TypeScript and never reaches the graph — testing a new arch rule by adding an unused `import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm'` reports "no dependency violations" and reads as a working rule that is in fact never exercised. Verify with an import the file actually uses. Evidence: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:82`.

- **2026-08-05** — `dependency-cruiser` cannot enforce any ban on an npm PACKAGE in this repo because `options.exclude` drops `node_modules` from the graph entirely, so package-level import rules (e.g. "routes must not import `drizzle-orm`") have to live in `eslint.config.mjs` as `no-restricted-imports` — the graph tool covers only local paths like `^src/db/schema`. Evidence: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs:95-97`.

- **2026-08-05** — `@fastify/autoload` is a declared dependency that no source file imports, so the dependency list implies a filesystem-autoloaded route tree that does not exist — registration is static in `src/modules/index.ts` on purpose. Evidence: `grep -rn "autoload" src/` returns only the comment at `src/modules/index.ts:17`.

- **2026-08-05** — `dependency-cruiser` sits in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`, because it runs **in-process at runtime** as the repo-intel depgraph adapter (`cruise()` builds the file-level import graph) — moving it to devDependencies would break indexing in a production install. Evidence: `package.json:25`, `src/adapters/depgraph/index.ts:17`.

- **2026-08-05** — A schema edit that DROPS one column while ADDING others makes `pnpm db:generate` block on an interactive rename prompt ("Is `category` column in `conventions` created or renamed from another column?"), and that prompt reads the tty directly — `yes '' | pnpm db:generate` and `printf '\r' | script -qec …` both hang until killed. What works is a pty plus a delay before each keystroke: `(for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do sleep 2; printf '\r'; done) | script -qec "pnpm db:generate" /dev/null` (default answer = create column). Evidence: `src/db/migrations/0016_same_gargoyle.sql` (was `0015_…` before the journal repair renumbered it).

- **2026-07-29** — `pnpm db:migrate` dumps raw Postgres NOTICE objects (`'extension "vector" already exists, skipping'`, code 42710) that read like errors but are idempotent skips — the run is fine iff it ends with `✓ migrations applied`. Evidence: `src/db/migrate.ts` sets no `onnotice` handler, so the `postgres` client logs every notice to stderr.

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

- **2026-10-07** — A per-route `config.rateLimit` is inert in tests:
  `@fastify/rate-limit` is registered only when `config.nodeEnv !== 'test'`
  (`src/app.ts:102-104`), so a "6th POST returns 429" case never passes under
  `appWith`. Build that one app with `nodeEnv: 'development'`. Related: a handler
  that rethrows `AppError` turns a missing provider key into a 500, because
  `ConfigError` extends `AppError` with status 500; a feature that must answer
  409 has to map non-feature errors itself (`src/modules/brief/service.ts`).
  `test/brief.it.test.ts`.

- **2026-10-07** — A line written with `runLog.info(...)` in
  `src/modules/reviews/run-executor.ts` AFTER the trace object is built never
  appears in the persisted trace, only on the SSE stream: the trace's `log` is
  `runLog.logFor(runId)`, evaluated at construction. Emit run-level lines (e.g.
  the `project context: N docs, +~T tokens` line) before that point. Related
  test trap: `agent_runs.status = 'done'` is written BEFORE `run_traces` is
  saved, so an it-test that reads `/runs/:id/trace` right after
  `waitForPrRuns` can get `404 Run trace not found` — poll for the trace.
  `test/project-context-run.it.test.ts`, `test/helpers/runs.ts`

- **2026-10-01** — `GET /pulls/:id/blast` on a PR that was only polled, never
  opened, answers `0 changed symbols … degraded: true`: `pr_files` is filled by
  the PR-detail GET (`GET /pulls/:id`), not by the poll, so the route sees no
  changed paths. Open the PR once (UI or `GET /pulls/:id`) and ask again.
  `src/modules/blast/repository.ts` (`getChangedPaths`),
  `src/modules/pulls/routes.ts`

- **2026-10-01** — `test/reviews.it.test.ts` fails on a clean tree too (2–3 of
  6 tests, varying between runs): `reviews[0].findings[0].id` throws because
  `GET /pulls/:id/reviews` comes back empty. Not caused by feature work —
  confirm with `git stash -u` before chasing it. `test/reviews.it.test.ts:250`

- **2026-09-26** — A route test asserting `400` for a bad `:id` fails: zod
  validation errors return `422` (`validation_error`) in this app, not the
  Fastify default. Assert `422`, e.g. `GET /pulls/not-a-uuid/smart-diff` in
  `test/routes-smoke.test.ts`. `server/src/app.ts:122-133`, `src/errors.ts:27`

- **2026-09-25** — Any LLM call added to `ReviewRunExecutor.executeRuns` runs
  before every agent, and `test/reviews.it.test.ts` overrides only the
  `openai` and `anthropic` providers (`appWith`, line 113). The intent step
  resolves `review_intent` to `openrouter`, so on a machine whose
  `~/.devdigest/secrets.json` holds an OpenRouter key the tests make REAL paid
  calls and 3 of them (accept/dismiss and both anthropic cases) blow past
  `waitForPrRuns`' 10 s; in CI there is no key, the call throws and is
  swallowed, so it stays green. For a hermetic local it-run use an empty
  `HOME`, and keep the Docker socket explicit — changing `HOME` alone makes
  `docker info` fail and every it-test silently skips (`8 skipped`):
  `HOME=$(mktemp -d) DOCKER_HOST=unix:///Users/<you>/.docker/run/docker.sock
  pnpm exec vitest run .it.test`. The lasting fix is an `openrouter` mock in
  `appWith`. `MockLLMProvider` also throws "fixture failed schema" for a schema
  with no `structuredBySchema` entry (`pr_intent`). Evidence:
  `test/reviews.it.test.ts:113`, `test/helpers/pg.ts:22`,
  `src/modules/reviews/intent-deriver.ts`.

- **2026-09-19** — `column "cost_usd" does not exist` (500 on run start, 6 `*.it.test.ts` failures) meant the Drizzle schema and migrations had drifted: starter migration `0009` drops `agent_runs.cost_usd`, and the HW-1 cost/findings-count feature re-declared `costUsd` + `criticalCount`/`warningCount`/`suggestionCount` in `src/db/schema/runs.ts` without a migration. Fixed with `0010_worthless_slipstream.sql` (+ `0011_glamorous_night_thrasher.sql` for `agent_skills.enabled`) from `pnpm db:generate`, then hand-edited to `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` — a dev DB migrated by another branch already has these columns, `scripts/dev.sh` runs `db:migrate` on every start, and a plain `ADD COLUMN` aborts it with `column "cost_usd" of relation "agent_runs" already exists` (verified: both a fresh DB and a DB whose journal lacks the two rows now migrate cleanly); after any schema edit, run `pnpm db:generate` and expect "No schema changes" before committing. Evidence: `src/db/migrations/0010_worthless_slipstream.sql`.
  - **2026-09-20** — Recurred on `0012_salty_clea.sql` (`conventions.category`
    / `evidence_line`): `pnpm db:migrate` failed with `column "evidence_line"
    of relation "conventions" already exists` (code 42701) because the dev DB
    had been migrated from another branch. Same fix — hand-edit the generated
    file to `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. `evidence_line` / `category` already
    existed in that dev DB; `accepted` was missing there, so 0012 also adds it
    (`IF NOT EXISTS`). `db:generate` never emits `IF NOT EXISTS`, so expect
    to do this for every new ADD COLUMN migration while dev DBs are shared
    across branches. The test container prints the resulting `NOTICE …
    already exists, skipping` on every `*.it.test.ts` run; it is not an
    error.

- **2026-09-19** — The API now binds `127.0.0.1` (`API_HOST`, default in `src/platform/config.ts`) instead of `0.0.0.0`, because it has no auth and `PUT /settings` / `POST /settings/test-connection` can overwrite provider keys; set `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` only for a container. `parseRepoUrl` is anchored to `https://github.com/` or `git@github.com:` and `SimpleGitClient.clonePathFor` refuses paths outside `cloneDir` (owner `..` used to reach `rm -rf`). Evidence: `test/repos-helpers.test.ts`.
